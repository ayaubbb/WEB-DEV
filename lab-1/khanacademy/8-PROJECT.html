        <h1>Travel to Game of Thrones</h1>
        <p><em>Game of Thrones</em> is about powerful families (Starks, Lannisters, Targaryens) fighting for the Iron Throne in the medieval-inspired land of Westeros, while a supernatural threat looms in the icy North; key themes involve politics, war, family loyalty, betrayal, and survival, all set in a world with long seasons and dragons, with memorable quotes like "Winter is coming" and "A Lannister always pays his debts".</p>
        <p id = "second-text">A Song of Ice and Fire is the basis for the HBO television series Game of Thrones (2011–2019). The first season was broadly faithful to A Game of Thrones, but later the series diverged more from the novels.[147] A major change for the series was adding several years to the novel's timeline, increasing several characters' ages: Sansa (from eleven to thirteen), Arya (from nine to eleven), Bran (from seven to ten),[148] and Daenerys (thirteen to fifteen).</p>
