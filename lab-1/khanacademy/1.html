    <h1>my poem</h1>
    <p>O mistress mine, where are you roaming?<br>
O stay and hear! your true-love's coming
<br>That can sing both high and low;
<br>Trip no further, pretty sweeting,
<br>Journey's end in lovers' meeting--
<br>Every wise man's son doth know.<br><br>
What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
<br>Present mirth hath present laughter;
<br>What's to come is still unsure:
<br>In delay there lies no plenty,--
<br>Then come kiss me, Sweet and twenty,
<br>Youth's a stuff will not endure. </p>
