<!-- the semicolon at the end of the first line is gone.
If we run this code, only the first Hello shows (and there’s an error, 
you may need to open the console to see it). There are no numbers any more.
That’s because JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. 
So, the code in the last example is treated as a single statement.

"use strict";

alert("Hello")

[1, 2].forEach(alert);
</script>
<!--Such merging in this case is just wrong. We need to put 
a semicolon after alert for the code to work correctly.
This can happen in other situations also.-->
<script>
"use strict";

alert("Hello")[1, 2].forEach(alert);

<!--One-line comments start with two forward slash characters //-->
<!--Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */-->

<!--The directive looks like a string: "use strict" or 'use strict'. 
When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.-->
